<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Valentin Lefebvre</h1>
<h3 align="center">An electronics engineer with hardware as a hobby</h3>

This GitHub profile serves as a showcase for my personal electronics projects. Whether I’m building a custom reflow oven or an automated coop door, I strive to make my documentation as clear and accessible as possible so that anyone can understand the logic behind the design before using it.

I value continuous improvement:

> 🛠️ I’m always open to constructive criticism.
>
> 💡 If you find a bug, have a suggestion, or see a way to improve a design, please feel free to open an issue or reach out!
